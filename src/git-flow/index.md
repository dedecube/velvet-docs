## Git Standard Flow

This is the official Dedecube Git Standard Flow.

### Objectives

The Dedecube Git Standard Flow is designed to enhance:

- **Consistency**: Standardizes git operations across all projects, making it easier for team members to understand the state and progress of projects.
- **Code Quality**: Enforces a review process, ensuring that only well-tested and well-documented code gets merged.
- **Traceability**: Each commit is categorized (feat, fix, chore, etc.), making it easier to generate changelogs and understand the history of changes.
- **Collaboration**: Simplifies the process of multiple people working on the same project, reducing conflicts and streamlining merges.
- **Automation**: Eases the integration with CI/CD pipelines, as the flow can be automated based on the type of commits.
- **Rollbacks**: Easier to identify and revert specific changes, improving the speed and safety of hotfixes.
- **Documentation**: Commit messages act as a form of documentation, explaining why changes were made.
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand project history and coding standards.
- **Scalability**: As team grows, a standard flow can easily scale without causing confusion or bottlenecks.
